### dbserver (Database Server)

The goal of dbserver is to be a very simple & lightweight HTTP interface to your database. The aim is to have support for commonly used databases where It should be easy for the user to interface towards multiple different types of connections. 

#### use-case

- You have some database or persistent storage running and you want to interface with to it with HTTP.

- You have some database or persistent storage running and you want a middleware layer between them and some other service. 

- You want to add unnecessary abstraction to your cloud to make a already over-engineer solution even more over-engineered.
